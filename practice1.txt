here after creating a practice.txt on github 
i am creating practice1.txt locally so that a conflict will occure 

in order to solve it I have to first pull the remote changes and then try to push new changes
at the same time I am changing the practice1.txt locally and on the same line ie 5
and 6 . and the conflict will be created when i push it
